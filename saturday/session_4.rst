Designers + Developers: Collaborating on your Python project
=============================================

**Presenter:** Julia Elman, Mark Lavin

**Track:** II

**Description:**

Working in teams is an important part of what we do as developers & designers.
Whether it's desktop applications or mobile sites, we work together to create
successful end products. But how do we work together in different environments?
What is the best work-flow for a mix of skill sets?

We'll be talking about our various methods & work-flows that we found
successful in working collaboratively.

You've Got an Idea
+++++

Sometimes you get an idea for a project, you start mulling it over and
eventually you decide to work on it and try to make something.  You might start
recruiting people, and you're likely going to recruit from your circle of
friends, which means that they are probably a lot like you.

A Designer
^^^^^

Maybe you should try to recruit a designer?  A stock UI framework (Twitter
Bootstrap, for example) will only get you so far.

You need to bring in people who compliment your skillset, because if you bring
in more people like you, than the will help you get things done faster, but
maybe not better.

Beware Too Many Cooks
^^^^^

Keep your team compact, be selective, but seek for diversity.

Comfort Zones
+++++

Be careful not to go off into your own world and do your own thing, then try to
smash the whole thing together at the end.  Don't work in a silo.  Be willing
to get outside of your comfert zone and expertise.  Other people need your
feedback, even if you'r enot an expert in their line of work, because you can
have ideas that they might not think about.

Designers
^^^^^

It can be scary for designers (or anyone, really) to try to work with the
terminal, it can be very intimidating.  But designers should just dive in.

One of the best parts of collaboration is the knowledge exchange.  Developers
should be patient and help the designers, answer questions, and direct them to
good tools.  It will make your life easier to have your team up to speed.

Developers
^^^^^

We have to be willing to give up some control.  Many developers fall into two
categories:

* They don't have the confidence to say what is good design and what isn't
* They don't care enough to pay attention

You can and should know what good design is.  Pay attention to things that work
intuitively, make a mental note of them, bring that to the table.

Developers should work on being better designers, think about how to make your
software more intuitive for the users.

Automation
+++++

Use your expertise to remove the cruft so that you can focus on the idea.
Automate the menial tasks.

* Setting up dev environment
* Deployments
* Builds
* Testing

Let designers and developers focus on the details of the idea.

Documentation
+++++

Document everything you can't automate.  Tailor those documents to every type
of person that needs them.  If you want people to get involved in your awesome
idea, you should document what you have so far.

Bottom Line
+++++

In good collaboration you are stretched beyond your skillset and you learn
something.

Also, in a good collaboration, failure becomes an option, because the act of
the collaboration becomes the real positive outcome.  The success of the
projcet itself matters less because you have improved yourself.

It's ok to fail in a good collaboration, as long as you don't fail at
collaborating.

Example
+++++

Wanted in page editing, using the power of the Django templating language, and
wanted the developer to be able to put in sane defaults for when there isn't
anything in the database.

Developers start thinking about the technical challenges right away, they start
thinking about what they know they can do, and become sceptical.

They started talking about it to people, who shared additional ideas.

Closing Thoughts
+++++

People can contribute a lot more to a project than just git commits.
